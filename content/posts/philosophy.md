It can play a role how you approach productivity, with what mindset you look at it, what mental models you build and use to think about it. This is what I would call the philosophy of productivity.

## Todos

One example is how you look at a **to do** list. It can be tasks ahead, such as *"feed the penguins"*. You could also look at it as a **done** list, and formulate your todos from the perspective of their results, such as *"the penguins are well fed"*. Or you you take another perspective and define a **not to do** list, which keeps you away from distractions, such as *"don't feed the seals"*.

I also like the notion of **"todo bankruptcy"**. Todos tend to accumulate. There seems to be an inherent natural law that todo list always grow bigger over time up to a point where you can't possibly even think of getting everything done on the list. Giving up on the list, declaring todo bankruptcy and start fresh is one strategy how to deal with it. An elegant way is to switch [tools]({{< relref "tools" >}}).

## Busyness

> If you want to get something done, ask a busy person to do it.

I always was fascinated by the truth in this saying. Itâ€™s such a great example of unintuitive but insightful wisdom.

There are two angles I like about it in particular:

The first is the beauty of constraints it expresses. If you are busy, if you are limited in time, you need to use your time well.

The second is the learning it implies. Doing things keeps you busy, and from doing things you learn. One of the things you learn is how to do more.
