How can you modify your behavior to be more productive? How can you create an environment which gets you done more? What psycholgiccal effects can you utilize to achieve more? It boils down to the question: **What are the protocols you can follow to increase productivity?**

## Focus

One of the factors which has the biggest impact on productivity is focus. If you direct your energy on one target, success can feel effortless.

### Dragon Day

One of the most interesting protocols I have experimented with is the Dragon Day. It creates an extremly strongly focusing enviroment to get work done on one day with 10 hours of work and 4 hours of breaks. It mixes exercises for the body and the mind, and can have amazing results.

### Developer Sprints

Another approach is what we in KDE call developer sprints. Hackathons are a variant of it. These are software development oriented, but the concept also has been adapted for example for book sprints.

I have written about how I experienced developer sprints on my blog:

* [Running on cheese and chocolate](https://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/2014/08/running-on-cheese-and-chocolate_26.html)
* [Anatomy of a developer sprint](https://blog.cornelius-schumacher.de/2010/01/anatomy-of-developer-sprint.html)

## Clear mind

When reading about the Getting Things Done method, the thing which resonated most with me was the "sweeping your mind" practice, i.e. writing everything down what is on your mind and putting it in the system, so that you never have to worry about forgetting something or missing something. If this works it gets you a clear mind.

Another interesting perspective I found in the book "When it gets crazy at work". After reading it I would say the real title of the book is "Choose calm". It contains a lot of thoughts about how to be productive without giving in to the crazyness of work.
