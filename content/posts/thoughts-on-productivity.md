This site collects some thoughts about productivity.

## Why think about productivity?

We all have limited time and energy. How to put this to good use is a question which is relevant to most people. If you have ideas, ambitions, goals, dreams, you will have to be mindful about how you go about them in order to achieve what you want to achieve.

It probably is dependent on your personality how much you want to think about productivity. I'm for example an [Enneagram Type Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality), nick-named the "achiever". Productivity often is on my mind. 

## What is productivity?

> Productivity is the efficiency of production of goods or services expressed by some measure. Measurements of productivity are often expressed as a ratio of an aggregate output to a single input or an aggregate input used in a production process, i.e. output per unit of input, typically over a specific period of time. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity)

Here we are taking a less economic and a more personal perspective. We are thinking about personal production of the things we create as part of our life. This might be goods and services, but it also could be ideas, thoughts, chores, art, craft, maybe it can even be applied to things such as relationships, emotions, fun.
