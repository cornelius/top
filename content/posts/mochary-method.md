Matt Mochary is a business coach who has coached a lot of big names in the tech space, startups, investement firms. He openly shares his method, which is a collection of a lot of great tactical advice, put together from all kind of sources.

His target audience are CEOs, but the method contains a lot of elements which are useful in different roles as well.

Read on the big collection as a Google Document with plenty to material and references: [Mochary Method Curriculum](https://t.co/A8J51IzYhz).

One of the core pieces is [fear and anger](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDWHUm6zwEGiPBQH2Ig6DDvVL-IEQSlfNeQnR2mhjmE/edit), how they give bad advice and how to get out of this.

Another core piece is "Top Goal", reserving time for working on your own top priority, not letting outside requests eat up all of your time. In a [Lenny's Podcast](https://youtu.be/bCel0X2Ta7U) he shared that he is doing this himself with an accountability partner, which forces him to focus. You could do this with the support of an app, such as [Supporti](https://www.getsupporti.com/).

There is a lot more, what you will already know, such as Inbox Zero, Getting Things Done, etc.

One thing I found particular interesting is the [Energy Audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmaRdtk8R5GQtMj72Y6XhHTru5SQAiiqDfDP3qy73k4/edit). By identifying what activities bring you energy and getting rid of activities which lower your energy you get to work in the "genius zone". This is where you work on things you truly enjoy and where you are truly excellent. According to Matt magic happens there.
