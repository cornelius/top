Productivity has some different aspects. One of them is tools. That's kind of the industrial perspective. Use the right tools and you will get more done. Improve your tools and your productivity will increase.

For personal productivity, especially for intellectual work, a lot of tools are software tools. There is a whole class of productivity software. It is related to personal information management or knowledge management. All can help you to get more efficient with your mind.

I have worked on a number of tools which I would put into the productivity software category.

I started with [KOrganizer](https://apps.kde.org/korganizer/), [KDE](https://kde.org)'s calendar and todo application.

One of the more sophisticated experiments was [Bliss](https://github.com/cornelius/bliss). I still use it today to organize my work.

A tool I use for implementing [Personal Kanban](https://www.personalkanban.com/) is [Trello](https://trello.com).

And somehow [git](https://git-scm.com/), often augmented by [GitHub](https://github.com), is at the center of a lot of these tool-based approaches.
